Journal Entry #1:
Today, I downloaded Android Studios into this computer. My first impression on this thing was that it is really kinda hard to use, because it asked me some stuff about "activities", which is kinda like a layer in photoshop. I'm still brainstorming ideas, but maybe I might not make a platformer, because well it's going to be mobile, and mobile platforms are kinda hard to control, so I'm most likly going to make another annoying game close to geometry dash, but It's going to be different. Also I've started creating my activities that I'm going to use for an game. Ideally, my game is going to be basically like a game where you try to like fly up, and try to dodge incomming obstacles. I'm still not exactly sure how to use Android Studios, because I'm going to do some research during the next few days, and see if I can get it. I feel like this project is going to be hard, so I'll try my best to do well on it.

Journal Entry #2:
In this week, I've stared to have some problems with Android Studios. It was very complex, and with some of Colin's guidance, I've managed it a little. I'm currently reading a simple tutorial about Android Studios. From what I've noticed so far, Android Studios seems to be like a mix between a little bit of HTML, and also JAVA. I'm not entirely sure that my observation is right, because well I just started using this program. What's nice is that it comes with even an emulator, which makes it alot easier, I don't have to use like 2 USB chords. Like I said in my last journal entry, I'm gonna make it maybe an interesting game, like those which you can change gravity. I'm still not sure, because once I come with an idea, I come up with like 5 obstacles that I have no idea how I should clear it. So I'm probably gonna not start programming anything soon, but just mess around with it until I get it. I play to really start my coding, by next week.

Journal Entry #3:
In this week, I finally got the chance to download Android Studios on my home computer. I've improved a lot about how to use it, mainly because of the fact that I mess around it whenever I have free time. With some of Colin's guidance, I've created a simple game on it. There are way too much commands, and weird keywords in Android Studios. One that stands out to me is "toast". I've been looking up all of the commands on Android Studios. Like I said earlier, there's weird names, but even worse is that some names are confusing, and makes no sense when compared to what the keyword is supposed to do. The game I created was basically a four squared game, that had exactly no purpose at all. The only purpose would be probably determining a coin flip. You can click on any of the four squares, and it will print either "true" or "false". Both had a 50% probability. This is the start, and I'm going to legit start on my game next week now.

Journal Entry #4:
In this week, I've made big improvements. I now basically mostly understand all of the commonly used parts of Android Studio for games like: Buttons, scroll bars, completion bars (which can be used for displaying health, completion of the level, and experience, which I'm not gonna have). Others also include the most important, which would be a canvas. I know there's gotta be a way to get the canvas, but searching and researching about canvases on Android Studio hasn't gotten me anywhere. On Thursday, I tried to mess with the code with java, and the coding in Android Studio is actually pretty similar to java. I turned in my project on Friday, and it isn't exactly a plat former, but just me messing around with Android Studio. I've probably said this earlier, but in Android Studio, it's really stupid how you have to save all of your text, your sounds in more than one location. In my case, I had to save all of my files at least twice. I'm starting to like Android studio a little more, and the 20% project doesn't seem as impossible anymore.

Journal Entry #5:
In this week, I didn't really do much :(. I didn't really open Android Studio at all, except to do some simple things. I basically decided to work on my sorting algorithms, which I don't really get merge. So really, I have nothing to really write about. One thing I did investigate on is another way to get something very close to a canvas. I'm gonna try it on Monday. Hopefully, it'll work, because if it doesn't, then I'll have to probably change my whole project, because, without a canvas, there's no way you could get a plat former to work. There isn't really much other stuff to write here, so I'll try to reach the 150 word limit, by talking about how I'm gonna reach the 150 word limit. Android Studio is getting better, and I feel like, to me, Android Studio could actually workout pretty well in the end.
