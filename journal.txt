Today, I downloaded Android Studios into this computer. My first impression on this thing was that it is really kinda hard to use, because it asked me some stuff about "activities", which is kinda like a layer in photoshop. I'm still brainstorming ideas, but maybe I might not make a platformer, because well it's going to be mobile, and mobile platforms are kinda hard to control, so I'm most likly going to make another annoying game close to geometry dash, but It's going to be different. Also I've started creating my activities that I'm going to use for an game. Ideally, my game is going to be basically like a game where you try to like fly up, and try to dodge incomming obstacles. I'm still not exactly sure how to use Android Studios, because I'm going to do some research during the next few days, and see if I can get it. I feel like this project is going to be hard, so I'll try my best to do well on it.
