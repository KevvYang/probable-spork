Journal Entry #1:
Today, I downloaded Android Studios into this computer. My first impression on this thing was that it is really kinda hard to use,
because it asked me some stuff about "activities", which is kinda like a layer in photoshop. I'm still brainstorming ideas, but maybe I
might not make a platformer, because well it's going to be mobile, and mobile platforms are kinda hard to control, so I'm most likly
going to make another annoying game close to geometry dash, but It's going to be different. Also I've started creating my activities that
I'm going to use for an game. Ideally, my game is going to be basically like a game where you try to like fly up, and try to dodge
incomming obstacles. I'm still not exactly sure how to use Android Studios, because I'm going to do some research during the next few
days, and see if I can get it. I feel like this project is going to be hard, so I'll try my best to do well on it.

Journal Entry #2:
In this week, I've stared to have some problems with Android Studios. It was very complex, and with some of Colin's guidance, I've
managed it a little. I'm currently reading a simple tutorial about Android Studios. From what I've noticed so far, Android Studios seems
to be like a mix between a little bit of HTML, and also JAVA. I'm not entirely sure that my observation is right, because well I just
started using this program. What's nice is that it comes with even an emulator, which makes it alot easier, I don't have to use like 2
USB chords. Like I said in my last journal entry, I'm gonna make it maybe an interesting game, like those which you can change gravity.
I'm still not sure, because once I come with an idea, I come up with like 5 obstacles that I have no idea how I should clear it. So I'm
probably gonna not start programming anything soon, but just mess around with it until I get it. I play to really start my coding, by
next week.
