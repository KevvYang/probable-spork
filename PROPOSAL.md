# Proposal: Creating an APP with Android Studios
I'm going to create a platformer for my project
Kevin Yang

## Needs and Opportunities
I've noticed, in the past when I played games, that games get boring after a while (even hearthstone).
I'm going to create a game that won't be boring, because it's going to be a platformer with also a like
enemies that you can hit, with like some kind of weapon.
## Audience / Clients / Users
Any gamer from any age will benefit from my creation, because I know that all gamers hate it when they get
bored of a game.

## Product
I will be making a game on Android Studios. It's going to be a platform, and I'm going to make sure that 
there will be kinda like mario, like with worlds, and also levels.

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine.

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | a working platformer, without any items, or enemies|
| April 1       | adding players, enemies, weapons, armor, and also possibily difficulty levels |
| April 29      | a game that has been polished, and is working perfectly|

## Reality Check
I am looking for moonshots here, but even moonshots need budgets. What
equipment are you going to need? What other capital expenditures do you
anticipate, and how will you meet them?

I don't need anything, because I will be making an app in android studios, and so I won't be needing any hardware
except for like a android phone, that I have, so I don't need one to be provided for me

## Conclusion
Wrap it up. Why are you fired up about this project? Inspire us to support you,
and give us a great reason to approve your project.

My project is going to be amazing, because it's going to be a game that won't be boring! I'm thinking that maybe
if I could add a little twist, like you're in a dark room, and you can create beams of light that bounces off walls
or something of that fashion to make it different. Really, I just want to make my game different than modern day 
platformers, because I know that difference is one way to sucess, or to failure. But I know that my program is going
to be awesome, so I know it's going to suceed.
