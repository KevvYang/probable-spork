# Proposal: Creating an APP
I don't know yet
Kevin Yang

## Needs and Opportunities
I haven't discovered any problems, but some games are pretty boring after an while, so I'm gonna try to create a game that isn't really boring,
## Audience / Clients / Users
People that have alot of time will benefit from this game. I don't know yet

## Product
I will be making a game made of the android app maker. I'm not exactly sure what I'm gonna do, but it's gonna be a fun game, most likely a platform

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Chec

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | my code |
| April 1       | a working game |
| April 29      | a game that's prefect |

## Reality Check
I am looking for moonshots here, but even moonshots need budgets. What
equipment are you going to need? What other capital expenditures do you
anticipate, and how will you meet them?

I don't think that I need any equiptment

## Conclusion
Wrap it up. Why are you fired up about this project? Inspire us to support you,
and give us a great reason to approve your project.

You should approve this project, because it seems like it would be a good idea to make, and I would think that it would also be pretty fun to make
